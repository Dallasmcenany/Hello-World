# Hello-World
Hello,

  A little bit about me. I am a father of a beautiful daughter named Sailor McEnany. She is the light of my world and I am trying to begin a career is front-end-development to produce income for my family. I have a wonderful wife named Alex who is my rock and support through this process. I have a background in Fine-Arts, but everything didnt turn out fine when I graduated college with a BFA Degree. So, I have re-forced my efforts to become something better than the man I am today. When I am ready I will obtain that job I desire and make the money my family needs to live a happy life. 
  
  Cheers,
  DM
